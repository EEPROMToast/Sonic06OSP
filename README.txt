Hello fellow Sonic Fans as well as bored developers!
    
    Disclaimer:
    I do NOT own the Sonic The Hedgehog Intellectual Property but luckily SEGA has been pretty laxxed with fan games
    when its non-profit and I doubt they'll touch this game due to its bad reputation.
    REMEMBER KIDS! NINTENDON'T MAKE A MARIO FAN GAME BUT SONIC SAYS MAKE A SONIC FAN GAME! XD
    All jokes aside, if you fork this project and decide to make money off of it, you are on your own when SEGA's lawyers
    come knocking on your door. I am in no way responsible for your greed, I'm just a fan trying to make the worst Sonic game into the best Sonic game. 
    I would also like to credit ChaosX for his hard work in making Project 06 which this project is based on. It was due to his tireless work that the game is this good! That being said, I would probably be speaking on behalf of most
    Sonic fans in saying that I am too impatient to wait for the finished result, so now I am taking action to SPEED IT UP a little (pun entirely intended).

    As of now, this is just a mess of compiled assembly byte code and all the files from the original XBOX 360 iso. I am hoping some Sonic fans out there more qualified than me will be able to help me put this together by making
    contributions and forks of this project. Here is the ground work, so hack away like Dr. Eggman hacking into GUN to find details on Project Shadow. The good Doctor will reward you with your own pet badnik.

    Happy hacking everyone! Remember, you're not allowed to use a Chaos Emerald to teleport to a dimension where this already exists and clone the project to a flash drive.
